Multiple Honda dealers India Today spoke with said that they will return Rs 21,000 in case a buyer cancels the booking. They also observed that the official bookings for the Elevate will commence in the first week of July.

While the Honda Elevate will be on display at the dealerships from August, its prices will be announced and customer deliveries will begin either towards the end of August or early September. We expect the Honda Elevate prices to be in the range of Rs 10.50 lakh to Rs 18 lakh (ex-showroom).
